### Hi there 👋

Thanks for checking out my Github profile! I'm Yifei, currently a 3rd year Software Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. Feel free to check out some of my projects; I've got a lot of ideas, but only some of them ever make it here 😅  If you only have time to check out one thing, please take a look at [flatten.ca](https://flatten.ca), and its code [here](https://github.com/flatten-official)! We were featured on [CTV](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/canadian-university-students-create-map-of-self-reported-potential-covid-19-cases-1.4872245) [Globe&Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-how-big-data-population-health-and-other-scientists-are-trying-to-map/) and [more](https://www.flatten.ca/about) 👀

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Spotify++, because my music tastes are just a bit too wack for Spotify's algorithms to handle
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning: Python, because `thing = { 'a' : {'b' : 12 } }` is so much nicer than `std::unordered_map<char, std::unordered_map<char, int>> thing; ...`
- 🎒 I've previously interned at: Splunk, Altis Labs, The Co-operators, OICR

Hope to hear from you!
